# Selenium Automation Testing Practice

This project serves as a comprehensive learning exercise in **Selenium** and **TestNG** for automation testing. It automates tests for [Test Automation Practice](https://testautomationpractice.blogspot.com/), covering a wide range of elements and components on the site. Created to build practical knowledge of **Selenium** and **TestNG**, the project includes various test cases that validate most of the site's functionalities. As a learning-focused project, there may be some areas that can be improved or optimized. 

# Test Configuration

The test suite runs in parallel on both Chrome and Edge browsers, as specified in the `testng.xml` file. Each browser runs the same set of test packages covering a wide range of components like input fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, date pickers, and more.

# Test Reporting

Reports are generated using **ExtentReports** and can be found in the `reports` folder after execution. These reports provide detailed insights into each test case's execution and results.
